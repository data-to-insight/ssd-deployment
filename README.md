# ssd-sql-tools
SQL tool library for creating and querying the Standard Safeguarding Dataset. 

[in progress]
Towards providing the needed toolset for creating of the SSD in a platform agnostic manner with near-zero overheads for your LA. 

Alongside creating the SSD from any CMS system and most common DB's, the aim is to provide a collaborative collection of SQL scripts developed specifically to work against the SSD to enable both statutory returns and further data analysis. Feedback and contributions from any local authority data stakeholders welcomed.
